<H1>Speed-up and regularization techniques for seismic full waveform inversion</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p>Seismic imaging methods allow to reconstruct the earth¡¯s subsurface parameters based on partial mea-
surements of elastic waves at, or near, the surface. Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a numerical
optimization problem that uses the whole waveform information of all arrivals to update the subsur-
face parameters that govern seismic wave propagation. FWI has shown to provide high quality images
and now constitutes a production imaging tool in reservoir exploration. However, FWI still faces many
challenges, specially in the topics of the image resolution, computational cost and non-linear optimiza-
tion. This thesis concerns some aspects to reduce the computational cost and the use of regularization
techniques in the optimization problem. </p>
<p>Currently, the main limitation to perform 3D elastic full waveform inversion on a production level
is the computational cost it represents. With this in mind, we provide two contributions. First, we
develop a self adjoint formulation of the isotropic first order velocity-stress elastic equations that allow
to implement only one forward modeling operator in the gradient computation. Second, solving the
forward problem is the most computationally expensive part of FWI, and its cost is proportional to
the number of sources (> 10 3 in 3D). To gain efficiency, instead of solving the wave equation for each
source, it is possible to solve the wave equation for a linear combination of the sources. This is known as
source encoding, and has been widely used when combined with steepest descent or conjugate gradient
algorithms in the optimization process. With the purpose of reducing even more the computational
cost, we combine Newton and quasi-Newton optimization methods with source encoding techniques.
We implement this in a 2D frequency domain acoustic modeling engine based on frequency, but the
results are easily extendible to the 3D frequency scenario. Our synthetic numerical tests were carried
out in the BP-2004 salt model which is a realistic configuration inspired by the Gulf of Mexico, and
the real data we used is an ocean bottom cable dataset recorded from the Valhall field in the North
Sea. We find that the lowest computational cost needed to attain a predefined misfit value is provided
by l-BFGS, with periodic restarts. However, with noisy data, the most accurate and robust direction
of descent is provided by Newton methods, with and without source encoding. </p>
<p>The optimization process requires regularization constraints because the model is not entirely con-
strained by the data, and more than one model may fit the observed data equally well. We see that
the total variation of the model as a regularization term provides and adequate description of earth
models. To improve the quality of the images of the earth parameters, we propose a local total vari-
ation denoising algorithm based on the incorporation of the information provided by a migrated image.</p>
