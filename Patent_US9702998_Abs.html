<h1>Full-wavefield inversion of primaries and multiples in marine environment</h1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>
Method for using the full wavefield (primaries, internal multiples and
free-surface multiples) in inversion of marine seismic data, including both
pressure and vertical velocity data (21), to infer a subsurface model of acoustic
velocity or other physical property. The marine seismic data are separated (22)
into up-going (23) and down-going (24) wavefields, and both wavefields are
inverted in a joint manner, in which the final model is impacted by both
wavefields. This may be achieved by inverting both wavefields simultaneously
(25), or one after the other, i.e. in a cascaded approach (35--37, or 4--47), for
the subsurface properties (26, 38, 48).
