<H1>Least-squares reverse-time migration toward true reflectivity</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p>Conventional least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) usually aims to improve the 
quality   of seismic image, by removing the 
acquisition footprint, suppressing migration 
artifacts, and  enhancing resolution. We find that the conventional 
reflectivity defined in the LSRTM is related to the normal-incidence reflection coefficient and the
background velocity. Compared with the defined 
reflectivity, our inverted result is approximate. With reflected 
data, LSRTM is mainly sensitive to 
impedance perturbations. According to an approximate relationship between them, we
reformulate the perturbation-related system into a pseudo reflection-coefficient related 
one. Then, we seek the inverted
image through linearized iteration. With the assumption that the 
density varies gradually compared to the migration
velocity, only the knowledge of the  velocity is required, although 
the  reflected waves are produced at impedance discontinuities. We 
validate our scheme using the 2D Marmousi synthetic dataset.</p>
