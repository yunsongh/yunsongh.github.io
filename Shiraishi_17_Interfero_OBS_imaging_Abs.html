<H1>Interferometric OBS imaging for wide-angle seismic data</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p> Marine wide-angle seismic data obtained using air guns and
ocean-bottom seismographs (OBSs) are effective for determining
large-scale subseafloor seismic velocities, but they are ineffective
for imaging details of shallow seismic reflection structures be-
cause of poor illumination. Surface-related multiple reflections of-
fer the potential to enlarge the OBS data illumination area. We
have developed a new seismic imaging method for OBS surveys
applying seismic interferometry, a technique that uses surface-re-
lated multiples similarly to mirror imaging. Seismic interferometry
can use higher order multiple reflections than mirror imaging,
which mainly uses first-order multiple reflections. A salient advan-
tage of interferometric OBS imaging over mirror imaging is that it
requires only single-component data, whereas mirror imaging re-
quires vertical geophone and hydrophone components to separate
upgoing and downgoing wavefields.We applied interferometric 
OBS imaging to actual 175 km long wide-angle OBS data ac-
quired in the Nankai Trough subduction zone. We obtained clear
continuous reflection images in the deep and shallow parts includ-
ing the seafloor from the OBS data acquired with large spacing.
Deconvolution interferometry is more suitable than correlation
interferometry to improve spatial resolution because of the effects
of spectral division when applied to common receiver gathers.
We examined the imaging result dependence on data acquisition
and processing parameters considering the data quality and target
depth. An air-gun-to-OBS distance of up to 50 km and a record
length of 80 s were necessary for better imaging. In addition, our
decimation tests confirmed that denser OBS spacing yielded better
quality and higher resolution images. Understanding crosstalk ef-
fects due to the acquisition setting will be useful to optimize meth-
ods for eliminating them. Interferometric OBS imaging merged
with conventional primary reflection imaging is a powerful meth-
od for revealing crustal structures.
