<H1>High 
frequency 
analysis of imaging 
with noise blending</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p>We consider sensor array imaging for simultaneous noise blended sources. We study a 
migration imaging functional and we
analyze its 
sensitivity to singular perturbations of the speed of propagation of the medium. We consider two kinds of 
random  sources:
randomly delayed pulses and stationary 
random processes, and three possible kinds of perturbations. Using high frequency analysis we
prove the statistical stability (with respect to 
the realization 
of the noise blending) of the scheme and 
obtain quantitative results on the image 
contrast provided by the 
imaging functional, which strongly depends on the type of perturbations.</p>
