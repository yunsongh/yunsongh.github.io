<H1>Wave-equation based velocity
inversion and migration of multiples</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p> In recent years, oil and gas exploration is encountering the seismic imaging
problems in the area with complex geological structures, thus in seismic data
processing wave-equation based prestack depth migration methods with high
accuracy have been widely used and intensively studied. However, there are still some
problems to be solved in the methods. Firstly, these migration methods require
high-resolution migration velocity model to generate correct subsurface images, but
how to construct an appropriate velocity model efficiently is a difficult issue in
academia and industry. We need to find a better solution to approximate the Hessian
matrix, reduce the influence of amplitude information on wave-equation traveltime
inversion and improve the computational efficiency of wave-equation full waveform
inversion. Secondly, the conventional migration methods only take primaries into
imaging process; however, the multiples also contain information of the subsurface,
which can also be utilized to improve the imaging quality. Migration of multiples is
significant complements for imaging the complex geological structures, and deserves
further study. The dissertation focuses on wave-equation velocity inversion and
migration of multiples; it involves wave-equation traveltime inversion, full waveform
inversion, migration of multiples, and the elimination of migration artifacts. The main
research progresses are as following:</p>

<ol>
<li> This dissertation introduces wave-equation traveltime inversion. By comparing
the effects of different numerical algorithms to the inversion result, limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm (L-BFGS) shows it gives the best
approximation of the Hessian matrix. L-BFGS bases wave-equation traveltime inversion 
can improve the resolution of inversion results and computational efficiency
effectively. The analysis of traveltime difference gives that traveltime difference based
on the cross-correlation of waveform is strongly influenced by the amplitude and
varies with the frequency of the observed data. Frequency-dependent wave-equation
traveltime inversion is proposed to relieve the influence of amplitude information,
reduce local minima in the inversion result and offer an initial model with high quality
for subsequent full waveform inversion. </li>
<li> The second part of the dissertation introduces the time domain waveform
inversion in detail. Based on multiscale early arrival waveform inversion, a pseudo
Hessian matrix in time domain is proposed to precondition the gradient and accelerate
the convergence rate. The real land data application shows the efficiency of the
proposed method. </li>
<li> In migration of multiples, the dissertation proposes data to data migration. The
approach avoids multiples prediction and wavelet estimation and it¡¯s quite effective
for migration of multiples. The defect is the noises in the final image. One-way
Fourier finite-difference migration and two-way reverse time migration are used to
implement data to data migration. To eliminate the noises in the image generated by
one-way wave-equation operator, we propose three methods: 1) using wide azimuth
data and 3D data to data migration to generate high-resolution, noise-free imaging
results; 2) in data domain use least squares migration to eliminate artifacts in iterative
process; 3) in image domain apply Radon transform to angle domain common image
gathers and eliminate the energy of noises. To improve the resolution of the image
generated by two-way wave-equation operator, we generate the reverse time
migration images by employing the imaging condition with wavefield separation.
The real marine data application shows the efficiency of data to data migration and
the approach to eliminate migration noises. </li>
<li> The dissertation combines the two research area and proposes a natural blended
full waveform inversion. It use multiples in the waveform inversion process of marine
data and reconstruct highly resolved velocity model with less data.</li>
