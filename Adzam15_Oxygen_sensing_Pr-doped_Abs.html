<H1>OXYGEN SENSING BEHAVIOUR OF Pr DOPED Eu1-x Prx Ba2 Cu3 O7-&delta; CERAMIC RODS WITH HOT-SPOT</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p>In this study, Eu 1 - x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 - &delta; ( x = 0 . 0 , 0.05, 0.10, and x =
0 . 20 ) ceramic rectangular rods were prepared by the solid-state
reaction method to investigate the effect of Pr doping on oxygen
sensing behaviours. X-ray powder diffraction analysis showed all rods
were orthorhombic in structure with reduction in orthorhombicity
upon doping. For all samples, the I - V curve showed a relatively
constant output current after the appearance of hot-spot. The
magnitude of the constant output current was observed to be
decreasing with increasing Pr doping which indicates possible
reduction in intrinsic hole concentration. In addition, the output
current for rods with x = 0 . 0 , 0.05 and 0.10 showed a sudden drop
upon the appearance of hot-spot, due to the sudden increase in hot-spot
temperature, before becoming slightly constant. However, the sudden
drop of output current upon appearance of hot-spot was not observed
when Pr was increased to x = 0 . 15 and 0.20 but instead a stable
output current was observed. Interestingly, the output current after
appearance of hot-spot for all rods showed strong dependency on
ambient oxygen concentration. The sensitivity for each rod, however,
reduces with increasing ambient oxygen concentration. The doping
seems to prevent the sensitivity from dropping to almost zero as was
previously reported for Eu ( Ba 1-y Pr y ) 2 Cu 3 O 7-Î´ rods due to existence
of Cu-O chains in the orthorhombic structure. Pr doping ( for x = 0 . 10 )
has also resulted in better oxygen absorption response time and better
output current stability compared to other rods.</p>
