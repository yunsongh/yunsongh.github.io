<H1>Application of Plane-wave Least
Square Migration in Fault Block
Reservoirs - A Case Study</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p>The lithological migration and preserved-amplitude migration problem of fault block reservoirs is rather
rough in the delicate exploration of Chinaâ€™s oil field. In this paper, we implement the prestack least square
reverse time migration based on plane-wave encoding to solve these problems with an improvement of
efficiency. The imaging test of plane-wave LSRTM algorithm and its comparison with RTM and poststack
LSRTM verify that the prestack LSRTM has the advantages including: (1) resolution enhancement and
amplitude compensation in mid-deep part with the increase of iterations which can be compared to
LSRTM (2) high computational efficiency to be practical (3) stable convergence even when the velocity
model is complex.</p>
