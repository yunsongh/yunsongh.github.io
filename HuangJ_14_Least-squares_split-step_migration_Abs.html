<H1>Least-squares split-step migration based on frequency-division encoding</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p> Phase encoding is one of the important strategies to improve mass data processing efficiency and it has been gradually used in seismic prestack
migration imaging and full waveform inversion. We propose in the paper a new migration approach based on frequency-division encoding. Based
on encoding shot records in the frequency domain before migration, we implement the least-squares split-step migration with frequency-division
encoding. We get the following observations by model tests: 1The validity of the method is proved by SEG/EAGE salt model processing;
2Through the comparison of the imaging results with different encoding schemes, we find that frequency-division encoding can not only obtain
high-quality migration, but also improve the efficiency of migration of mass data.
