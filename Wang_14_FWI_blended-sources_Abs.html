<H1>Full Waveform Inversion Using Free-Surface Related Multiples as Natural Blended Sources</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p> To improve the computational speed of conventional full waveform inversion (FWI), we propose a new
FWI method which uses free-surface related multiples as natural blended sources and name it as NBFWI.
The proposed method contains four key steps: 1. at selected source locations, forward propagate synthetic
wavelet to generate calculated shot records containing both primaries and free-surface related multiples; 2.
Compared with recorded field data to obtain waveform residuals; 3. backward propagate waveform
residuals and forward propagate recorded field data to produce gradient; 4. use steep descent method or
other optimization methods for velocity updating. Compared with other blended sources methods, the
NBFWI method has no need of implementing phase encoding algorithms and the free-surface related
multiples act as natural blended sources. A Marmousi velocity model is used for numerical tests. The
numerical results show how accurate, efficient and stable the proposed approach is when using different
number of shot gathers for inversion. Because of the utilization of wide coverage characteristics of free-
surface related multiples, the inversion procedure has good convergence even using very few shots. The
proposed approach is easy to implement and maybe significant for both fast velocity model building and
inversion of sparse acquisition data. </p>
