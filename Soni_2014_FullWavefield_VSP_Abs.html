<H1>Full Wavefield Migration of Vertical Seismic Profiling data</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p> 
Until now, in most seismic imaging technologies, both surface and internal multi-
ples are considered as noise. In today¡¯s industrial practice, we see various methods
for suppressing multiples before migration. This means that only a fraction of the
recorded wavefield is used in imaging. In this thesis, we present a method termed
full wavefield migration (FWM) that uses the multiple-reflections in the data
to improve the illumination of the field in areas that cannot be reached by the
primaries, to yield a better vertical resolution as well as to suppress migration
artefacts caused by crosstalk of multiple-reflections. </p>
<p> This thesis demonstrates the feasibility of full wavefield migration on a kind of
borehole seismic known as vertical seismic profiling (VSP). We know that in to-
day¡¯s practice, images obtained using VSP data always suffer from poor illumina-
tion and small aperture effects. Therefore, we expect in VSP acquisition geometry,
multiples can lead to significant improvement in illumination, both at the reser-
voir level as well as away from the well region. In this thesis, the advantage of
using multiples in full wavefield migration has been demonstrated. We validated
our algorithm on 2D synthetic and field VSP data.</p>
<p> Full wavefield migration is posed as an inverse problem, where the parameters
to be estimated are the subsurface reflectivities. We discuss an iterative forward
modelling engine termed full wavefield modelling which is used in the inversion
scheme. Full wavefield modelling allows us to compute the full wavefield (pri-
maries and all multiples) in terms of estimated reflectivities. In the full wavefield
modelling engine, we assume a scale-separation between the background migration
velocity that governs only the one-way wavefield propagation and the reflectivity
model that governs the two-way scattering. The modelling engine accounts for the
non-linearity of the wavefield due to reflectivity, incorporating the transmission
effects and multiple scattering at all depth levels. To solve the inverse problem,
we have used iterative conjugate-gradient scheme, which is a local optimization
method. </p>
<p> We also presents a solution for imaging of blended source VSP data using FWM.
The inversion-based imaging algorithm allows us to use any complex source wave-
field without the need for a separate deblending (pre-processing) step. This thesis
introduces the concepts of elastic full wavefield modelling and inversion. The elas-
tic modelling of P and S waves is illustrated for a horizontally layered medium
using a VSP geometry. The elastic imaging to estimate angle-dependent reflec-
tivity parameters that incorporates mode-conversions in subsurface layers is an
important area of future research. Nearly vertical structures such as salt-flanks
pose a migration challenge for conventional FWM. We have also extended the
FWM algorithm to incorporate turning-waves using horizontal one-way wavefield
extrapolation. Using this extension, we illustrate that FWM can be used to image
steep dips or near-vertical structures using the turning wavefield in VSP data.</p>
